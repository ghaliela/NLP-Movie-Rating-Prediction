# NLP-Movie-Rating-Prediction
Predict movie rating from movie plot

To run this code, you can either download it locally and then run it with a python notebook running
an R kernel. Then modify the read csv line to read from your local files. The csv file is on the repo.

Or you can upload this code to kaggle and link it to the TMDB 5000 Movies dataset.
Then you can run it directly.

Both notebooks use the same csv file, so the same manipulation described above is valid for both.
